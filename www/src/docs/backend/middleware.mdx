summary: Understanding and implementing middleware in JStack

# Middleware

Middleware in JStack allows you to add reusable logic between your procedure requests and handlers. It's perfect for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, or error handling.

---

## Basic Middleware Structure

```ts server/jstack.ts
const myMiddleware = j.middleware(async ({ c, next }) => {
  // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Code that runs before the handler
  // ...

  // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Pass data to the next middleware/handler
  return await next({ customData: "value" })
})
```

---

## Common Use Cases

### Authentication Middleware

The following middleware authenticates a user. When our procedure runs, we can be 100% sure that this user really exists, because otherwise the middleware will throw an error and prevent the procedure from running:

```ts server/jstack.ts {10-22, 29}
import { HTTPException } from "hono/http-exception"
import { jstack } from "jstack"

interface Env {
  Bindings: { DATABASE_URL: string }
}

export const j = jstack.init<Env>()

const authMiddleware = j.middleware(async ({ c, next }) => {
  // Mocked user authentication check...
  const isAuthenticated = true

  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    throw new HTTPException(401, {
      message: "Unauthorized, sign in to continue.",
    })
  }

  // üëá Attach user to `ctx` object
  return await next({ user: { name: "John Doe" } })
})

/**
 * Public (unauthenticated) procedures
 * This is the base piece you use to build new procedures.
 */
export const publicProcedure = j.procedure
export const privateProcedure = publicProcedure.use(authMiddleware)
```

On any `privateProcedure` we can now safely access the user object:

```ts server/routers/post-router.ts {5-6}
import { j, privateProcedure } from "../jstack"

export const postRouter = j.router({
  list: privateProcedure.get(({ c, ctx }) => {
    // üëá Access middleware data through ctx
    const { user } = ctx

    return c.json({ posts: [] })
  }),
})
```

## Middleware Chaining

Chain multiple middlewares using `.use()`:

```ts
const enhancedProcedure = publicProcedure
  .use(authMiddleware)
  .use(loggingMiddleware)
  .use(rateLimitMiddleware)
```

If you have multiple middlewares that depend on each other, by definition JStack cannot know the order in which they were run. Therefore, use the type inference utility:

```ts server/jstack.ts {14, 18}
import { InferMiddlewareOutput, jstack } from "jstack"

interface Env {
  Bindings: { DATABASE_URL: string }
}

export const j = jstack.init<Env>()

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Auth middleware runs first
const authMiddleware = j.middleware(async ({ c, next }) => {
  return await next({ user: { name: "John Doe" } })
})

type AuthMiddlewareOutput = InferMiddlewareOutput<typeof authMiddleware>

// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Logging middleware runs second
const loggingMiddleware = j.middleware(async ({ c, ctx, next }) => {
  const { user } = ctx as AuthMiddlewareOutput

  const start = performance.now()
  await next()
  const end = performance.now()

  console.log(`${user.name}'s request took ${end - start}ms`)
})

/**
 * Public (unauthenticated) procedures
 * This is the base piece you use to build new procedures.
 */
export const publicProcedure = j.procedure
export const privateProcedure = publicProcedure
  .use(authMiddleware)
  .use(loggingMiddleware)
```

## Using Hono Middleware

JStack is compatible with Hono middleware via the `fromHono` adapter:

```ts
import { j } from "./jstack"
import { cors } from "hono/cors"

const corsMiddleware = j.fromHono(cors())
const procedureWithCors = publicProcedure.use(corsMiddleware)
```

---

## Best Practices

- Keep middleware focused on a single responsibility
- Handle errors via your `appRouter`'s `onError()`

---

## Common Middleware Examples

- Authentication
- Request logging
- Rate limiting
- Error handling
- Request validation
- Performance monitoring
- CORS handling
